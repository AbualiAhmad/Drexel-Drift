# Drexel-Drift
Is Forza Horizon 5 too boring? Is Gran Turismo 8 taking too long to release? We get it; ambition can't wait.

That's why Triple B Studios is bringing Drexel Drift to the stage. Drexel Drift is a racing game built using Unity, it features cars modeled using Blender and scripted in C#. Furthermore, Drexel Drift contains tracks with timer and checkpoint features. Off the track, you can access a visual novel built around the universe of Drexel Drift.

Are you ready to beat the deadlines?
We'll see you on the track

## About BBB Studios

We are a group of four game-development newbies with no experience in both Untiy and C#. We wanted to challenge ourselves and learn new things through our CI102/103 project which is how we ended up developing our game, Drexel Drift.
